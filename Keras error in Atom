Hey, Atom gives me this mistake when I'm trying to import Keras:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras.models'; 'keras' is not a package

In Jupyter and IDLE of Python it works. With Atom I use Python 3.6.8 and in Anaconda Python 3.6.10.
In Atom Tensorflow works, Numpy, Matplotlib etc but not Keras. I also set the PATH system variables. I don't understand.
How can I do it?
Thank you
